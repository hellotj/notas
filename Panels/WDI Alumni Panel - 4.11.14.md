<h4>// 4.11.14 // Lunch </h4>

**Daniel Archer**: WDI 2. 

* Before was specialist at Apple store for 5 years. WDI 2. Did Wordpress themes for 11 years and tried learning Ruby on Rails by himself. Couldn't retain what he was learning.  
* Get in the habit of attending meetups. 
* JOB STATUS: Works at GA and is the evening course producer. During the day he works on his own company and is raising money. Feels comfortable to sit down and code and come up with a really good app within a day or two. 
> My hero is me in five years.
* Git commit early and often. When you git clone make sure you're in the right project.
* Over the first few weeks he wished he would have focused on his Angular.js version of Tic-Tac-Toe.
* A lot of people are familiar with GA already, but you kind of have to promote GA in what you learned. 
*  Wished that he did more standard based things like angular with rails.

**Julie Pranger** // WDI 2.

* Didn't have any prior experience.
* Through the first few weeks she felt like she was drowning. It was definitely hard. 
* Disagrees, it's important to balance coding and breathing time. 
* Testing was hardest for her. Has to hear something 1M times before it makes sense.
* After the course she took 3 weeks off. She had to figure out her direction and what type of company she'd fit with. She got a job offer about a month before she finished and she turned it down because the company didn't feel like the right fit. She was still figuring out how to brand herself. At the end of the day if she's just okay at one thing then you'll be lost in a sea of mediocrity. Found a job at a tech agency in Venice as a developer. She's the 3rd dev. The other two are CS people and are so much more advanced. 
> I am confident in my own abilities and I am extremely excited about learning. I know I am a complete beginner but I am so excited to gain more experience.
* Works primarily in javascript.  
* This program is great because it crosses over into a lot of other things. 
> A lot of companies wanted me to work with Python or Django. I don't know those but I love your company so I'll learn it!
* During first few weeks - wished she hadn't ever copied other people's code because it prevented her from understanding the topics.

**Ellie Hoshizaki** // WDI 4. 

* Really helpful to teach other people so it solidifies your own knowledge.
* Try learning from a lot of different resources so find a way that makes it click.
* JOB STATUS: Got a job offer before finishing the program but turned it down because it wasn't the right fit. Graduated 2 weeks ago so she's still figuring it out. 
* It's impossible to be fluent in everything. Look at job positions in front-end and see what languages they need and dedicate your time to those.
* Dont ever compare yourself to anyone else, just compare yourself to your own self from earlier in. 
* If you don't understand something then make sure you get to know people. 
* Interview Q: What does it feel like to be a woman in the tech industry? LOL. Should respond, "That's totally inappropriate." Turned down the job because it was more wordpress and she wanted to do javascript.
* Culture fit is extremely important because it will be a huge part of your life.

**Hamilton Chan** // WDI 4. 

* Prior was running 3 companies, commercial printing. Other 2 were YC startups. Frustrated working with dev's and wanted to get into the code. Didn't have any prior experience.  
* Hit the books really hard and tried his best to balance that with actual coding. 
* Don't wait til your fully ready to build to start building
* Don't compare yourself to others. It doesn't matter where your classmates are, just where you are. 
* Find a project you want to build yourself and then deploy it as fast as you can so people can see it. 
* Have a coding schedule. 
* JOB STATUS - Back to running businesses. Now his printing company offers dev services. 
* Feels really good about rails and front-end stuff. 
* Have a friend to support each other. Have a person that you can be honest with. 
* When in doubt, code! 
* Wished that he had mobile optimized his Tic-Tac-Toe and it was awkward whenever he tried to demo it.

**Kate Bankret** // WDI 4.

* Went to Stanford B-school. Didn't have any experience beyond excel.
* Wanted to code at Google but was totally overwhelmed. Now she's trying to figure it all out. 
* Angular.js is so cool, wished she had learned more.

**Alex Saldivar** // WDI 4.

* Did Data Analyst. Tweaked excel macro code.
* What were the first few weeks was okay. Slacked off when he went home he was done for the day. He should have stayed late and worked on stuff at home. 
* AJAX was hardest and Lorin explained it to him in 20 minutes and it became more clear. Set a time limit on how long you can spend on a problem before you ask a question. 
* <http://xyz-app.herokuapp.com/posts>
* GA has given the confidence to know how to learn the things he wants to learn when he looks at a job posting. But now he can teach himself how to go about it. 
* JOB STATUS - For the past 2 weeks he had an interview. Trying to hold off so he can practice responding to technical questions. 
* GREAT TOOL - YOUTUBE - Angular.js in 68 minutes. Would have focused on javascript and jQuery during the first two weeks. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM>
* Code School is definitely better than Codeacademy.
* Apprenticeship starts to not be as attractive because you can get a real job. As long as you have a mentor you're golden.  

**Dan Iwao** //  WDI 4. 

* Was a teacher. No coding experience and was tired of reading green eggs and ham. 
* He hated his life for the first couple weeks. Lorin was too brilliant and was hard to keep up with. You gotta just pound the code and cranked it out. Make as many Rock Paper Scissors as possible. Make it ten different times. 
* Crank out code til 1 AM every night.  
> Sleep is the cousin of death. 
* Hardest thing to do was AJAX and node.js. 
* Set 45 minute timer before he asked a question. 
* <http://gonechat.com> 
* Won't ever be fully prepared. He learned enough resources and tools to dive deep into what he enjoys. Now he's diving deep into front-end javascript.
* JOB STATUS - Has had 2 interviews, 1 went well and the other he bombed. Tons of people have been reaching out to do PHP Wordress type websites. Wants to work at Huge or Possible.  
* Would have done more tutorials. If something worked, break it on purpose and see why it broke. 
* Comment and Git Commit your code all the time. And use the console to sandbox. 
* Download: Javascript for professionals (red cover), skim through it. There are old CS questions you need to know. "What paradigm do you write your object out of?" Just say prototype. 

**Other Coding Events**

* If there's a hackathon, go to it!
* Facebook grades you on how many hackathons you go to. 
* Hackathon at UCLA tomorrow, Saturday.
