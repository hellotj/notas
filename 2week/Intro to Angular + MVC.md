<h2>Intro to Angular and Model View Controller (MVC)</h2>

<h4> 4.11.14 // Morning // Hannah + Marc </h4>

**Objectives**

* Describe the basic building blocks of MVC architecture
* Create a sample AngularJS App
* Recognize different componnet of Angular


**MVC**

* Provides architecture and scaffolding to help your GUI 
* Stands for Model View Controller
* MVC STands for Model View Controller

**What is Seperate Presentation?**

* What you model
* And how you present it
* Are seperate
* Great example of what it's not - Benihana

**Seperate Presentation in a Restaurant**

* What a restaurant does: prepare food
* how it present/delivers food?
* Partner exercise 

**Without Seperate Presentation**

* Have too many things on the floor

**With seperate presentation**

* Apple store and warehouse

**Model View Controller: Definition**

* Separate presentation from logic of application
* Model= Data/Logic
* View = Presentation
* Controller = Intermediary

**Classic MVC**
 
 * View Displays Data
 * Controller Processes Input
 * Bother Observe Model for Changes
 * Smalltalk 80 -- what's that? NeXT - became OS X then iOS
 
 **Rails: Server Side MVC**
 
 * View: Displays Page, Takes Raw User Input <-(Insert Internet Here)-> Contorller: Fetches Model Data for View Processes User Input <--> Underlying Model: Representts App Logic
 
 **Angular: Client Side MVC**
 
 * View: Displays User Interface <--(Two Way Data Binding!)--> Controller: Defines Accessible Data in View Processes User Input <--> Client Model: Thin Wrapper Around Server Calls <--(Insert Internet Here)--> Real Model: On the server
* So many ways to do MVC... MV* because the controller has taken on so many roles.
