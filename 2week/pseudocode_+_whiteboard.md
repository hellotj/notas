1. Declare a variable called "highestNumber"
2. Set "highestNumber" to be equal to the first number in the array
3. Cycle through each number, starting with the second number
4. Compare the number we're cycling through against highestNumber. If it is higher, assign it to be this newly-found number
5. Once all numbers are aligned take first and last number
6. Sum values of each 

Data modeling - freakn important. 


#####Why we pseudocode:
* Way to create algorithms
* Before you code, have a plan
* With the diversity of a given team, it allows more participation

#####Interviews

* Everyone wants to make money and they have an opportunity to asses if there's a fit.
