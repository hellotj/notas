*W3C* [World Wide Web Consortium] decides what the events are. It takes several years. 

*HTML5* is not a standard, it has not been officially approved yet. The invention of it was somewhat of a rebellion against W3C and the standards body is starting to adopt it because browsers are supporting it. 

*Touch + Pointer* events respond to mouse and touch actions. Pointer events aren't super widely supported yet.
