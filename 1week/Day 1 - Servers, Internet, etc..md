         * 
Peery Foundation internship team as team leader. We were flexible - we could take on new students if we needed. We all understood the deliverable and had a similar quality standard that we wanted to obtain. We were able to to divide into smaller groups and break up the workload into smaller pieces then report back on our progress. We all followed through with our progress and checked in on the progress of others. We were all willing to go above and beyond by traveling to EPA and interviewing people. We could make sacrifices for each other. We were all really excited at any level of progress, we never minimized any level of advancement.

How the Internet Works:
Objectives:

   * 
Identify + distinguish between different layers of the internet
   * 
identify the different components of a web application and recognize which role a framework or tool play
   * 
Be able to describe at least 2 potential stacks of web technologies that can make a web application


How do browsers work?

   * 
The resource format is usually HTML but also PDF, image and more. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform resource Identifier).
   * 
Web browsers are built of User Interface, Layout Engine, Rendering Engine, JavaScript interpreter, UI backend, Networking component and Data persistence component. These components achieve different functionalities of a web browser and together provide all capabilities of a web browser.


How do servers work?


Server - Computer that you can connect to on the Internet

Database - where information is stored that is accessible by a server.

TCP/IP - Two layered Protocol/TCP -> Fundamental low level protocol by which computers connect on the internet. Guarantee that by network traffic would get to its destination.

Browser - Software that allows you to access web pages on the internet. URL- identifier that allows you to find a web page.

HTTP - Hypertext transmission protocol - Data transmission between servers and browsers


Get, Post - Requesting Information, Asking to Change information


SSH - Secure Shell - If I want to use a secure tunne to login into a database. Sits on top of TCP/IP. 


FTP - File transfer protocol - transfer files to and from server. Sits on TCP/IP


Web 2.- - Content Curation/Sharing Content/Video Multimedia


Client / Server - Request/Response


Caching - Storing data on your computer so you don’t need to keep requesting data


HTML - XML that lets you formalize the structure of your information 





IN THE BEGINNING


   * The internet begins as the ARPANET
   * Standardize as TCP/IP becomes protocol
   * Services - FTP/Telnet/Gopher
   * But no web!

Web 1.0




Web 3.0 
Server persisting data and some logic (like authentication.)

      * Front-end logic - how the app keeps content up to date

   * Logic - How the app works

      * Back end

         * Infrastructure

            * how the app runs

         * Persistence
