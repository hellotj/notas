###CSS Positioning

**Class Outline**

1. inline vs block
2. override default behavior
3. position [static, relative, absolute, fixed]
4. Z-Index [the only way that you put something on top for sure of everything else.]

**Block Elements**

* Display: inline-block
* div
* table
* ul
* img
* visibility hidden [disappears **and** loses its formatting in relation to others]
* display:none [it's formatting in relation to other blocks stays the same] 

**Other Cool Commands**

* opacity [0.0-1.0]
