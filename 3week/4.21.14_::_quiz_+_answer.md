##4.21.14 // Quiz + Answer



####Quiz

**You have an array with nine elements in it (declared in your controller as $scope.cells = [' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' '];). You'd like a Tic Tac Toe game board (3 rows of 3 squares). Use an Angular directive to create this board from the array, and tell us what you'd have to do with the CSS to render a game board without changing anything about the array. *
Feel free to try out your code in Sublime or the console before pasting! Remember that "track by $index" is a means for avoiding a dupe error.**

####Answer

		$scope.cells = [' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' ',' '];
	(that's in the JS)
	
some style rules to help you along -- the really big key is that .board is only wide enough to hold 3 .cells
	
	<style>
	.board { 
	width: 500px; 
	}
	.cell {
		height: 150px;
		width: 150px;
		border: 3px solid blue;
		background-color: lightblue;
		float: left;
	}
	</style>

(in the template -- note that track by $index prevents Angular for getting mad at us for having duplicate values in our array, and nesting our ng-repeat in class board locks us in to a square-shaped TTT board)
	
	<div class="board">
          <div class="cell" x-ng-repeat="c in cells track by $index"></div>
        </div>
